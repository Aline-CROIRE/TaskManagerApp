   - Data persistence with AsyncStorage
   - Optimistic UI updates for better user experience
   - User-specific data isolation

## üõ† Technologies Used

- **React Native** - Mobile app framework
- **Expo** - Development platform and tools
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe JavaScript
- **React Navigation** - Navigation library
- **AsyncStorage** - Local data persistence
- **React Context API** - State management
- **Expo Vector Icons** - Icon library

## üì± App Screens

### 1. Authentication Screens
- **Login Screen**: Email/password authentication with validation
- **Register Screen**: User registration with form validation

### 2. Main Application Screens

## üöß Challenges Faced & Solutions

### 1. State Management Complexity
**Challenge**: Managing complex state across multiple screens and components.
**Solution**: Implemented React Context API for global state management with separate contexts for authentication and tasks.

### 2. Data Persistence
**Challenge**: Ensuring data persists across app sessions without a backend.
**Solution**: Used AsyncStorage for local data persistence with user-specific storage keys.

### 3. Form Validation
**Challenge**: Implementing robust form validation with good UX.
**Solution**: Created custom validation logic with real-time feedback and error display.

### 4. Navigation Flow
**Challenge**: Creating intuitive navigation between authenticated and public screens.
**Solution**: Used conditional rendering based on authentication state with proper stack and tab navigation.

### 5. Real-time Updates
**Challenge**: Ensuring UI updates immediately reflect data changes.
**Solution**: Implemented optimistic updates with proper error handling and rollback mechanisms.
